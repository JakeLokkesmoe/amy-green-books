Headstrong Johanna Berglund, a linguistics student at the University of  Minnesota, has very definite plans for her future . . . plans that do  not include returning to her hometown and the secrets and heartaches she  left behind there. But the US Army wants her to work as a translator at  a nearby camp for German POWs.

Johanna arrives to find the  once-sleepy town exploding with hostility. Most patriotic citizens want  nothing to do with German soldiers laboring in their fields, and they're  not afraid to criticize those who work at the camp as well. When  Johanna describes the trouble to her friend Peter Ito, a language  instructor at a school for military intelligence officers, he encourages  her to give the town that rejected her a second chance.

As  Johanna interacts with the men of the camp and censors their letters  home, she begins to see the prisoners in a more sympathetic light. But  advocating for better treatment makes her enemies in the community,  especially when charismatic German spokesman Stefan Werner begins to  show interest in Johanna and her work. The longer Johanna wages her  home-front battle, the more the lines between compassion and treason  become blurred--and it's no longer clear whom she can trust.
