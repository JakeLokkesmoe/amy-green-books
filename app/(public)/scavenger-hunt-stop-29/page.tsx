          Hello, readers! I&#8217;m <strong>Amy Lynn Green</strong>, writer of
          historical fiction, lover of books in all genres, and dispenser of SO
          MUCH useless trivia that starts, “Did you know that in World War Two…”
          I love to share fascinating historical details on Facebook and book
          recommendations and glimpses of the writing life on Instagram (feel
          free to join me there). In January, my latest novel,{" "}
          <Link href="/books/the-foxhole-victory-tour">
            <em>The Foxhole Victory Tour</em>
          </Link>{" "}
          released. Here&#8217;s a little teaser for the plot:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          During World War II, Catherine Duquette and Maggie McCleod come from
          different worlds but are thrown together on a USO variety show touring
          North Africa. While they each have secret reasons for accepting the
          job, neither anticipates the danger and intrigue they&#8217;ll
          encounter performing so close to the front lines.
        </blockquote>

        <H3>Would You Make it on the Foxhole Circuit?</H3>
        <p>
          Like I said, I love research and basing my novels on real WWII events,
          so when I found a copy of the guidebook the actual USO performers used
          as they toured close to the front lines, well…I read every page. Here
          are some actual dos and don&#8217;ts from the official{" "}
          <em>USO Guide to the Foxhole Circuit.</em>

          <strong>On Interacting with the Servicemen:</strong> “When the
          doughboy thinks of his girls from home, he thinks of his mom, his
          sister, or his best girl…Girls from home have to be nice.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>On the Dress Code:</strong> “A G.I. doesn&#8217;t want to see
          you in slacks and he&#8217;s not interested in your uniform. He wants
          to see you look like the girls back home on an important Saturday
          night date.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>On Hair Dye:</strong> “One thing you definitely won&#8217;t
          find in a PX is a bleaching agent. The G.I.s are not trying to be
          blondes. So—either take along your own peroxide or make up your mind
          to stay brunette until you get back home.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>On Behavior:</strong> “Don&#8217;t gripe, don&#8217;t feel
          sorry for yourself, and don&#8217;t argue with your fellow
          entertainers in public.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>On Terminology:</strong> “Don&#8217;t call the soldiers
          &#8216;boys.&#8217; The army has worked very hard to turn them into
          men.”
