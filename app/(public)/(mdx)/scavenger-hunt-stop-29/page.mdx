Hello, readers! I&#8217;m <strong>Amy Lynn Green</strong>, writer of
historical fiction, lover of books in all genres, and dispenser of SO MUCH
useless trivia that starts, “Did you know that in World War Two…” I love to
share fascinating historical details on Facebook and book recommendations and
glimpses of the writing life on Instagram (feel free to join me there). In
January, my latest novel, [_The Foxhole Victory Tour_](/books/the-foxhole-victory-tour)
released. Here&#8217;s a little teaser for the plot:

> During World War II, Catherine Duquette and Maggie McCleod come from different
> worlds but are thrown together on a USO variety show touring North Africa.
> While they each have secret reasons for accepting the job, neither anticipates
> the danger and intrigue they&#8217;ll encounter performing so close to the
> front lines.

## Would You Make it on the Foxhole Circuit?

Like I said, I love research and basing my novels on real WWII events, so when
I found a copy of the guidebook the actual USO performers used as they toured
close to the front lines, well…I read every page. Here are some actual dos and
don&#8217;ts from the official _USO Guide to the Foxhole Circuit._

**On Interacting with the Servicemen:** “When the doughboy thinks of his girls
from home, he thinks of his mom, his sister, or his best girl…Girls from home
have to be nice.”

**On the Dress Code:** “A G.I. doesn&#8217;t want to see you in slacks
and he&#8217;s not interested in your uniform. He wants to see you look like the
girls back home on an important Saturday night date.”

**On Hair Dye:** “One thing you definitely won&#8217;t find in a PX
is a bleaching agent. The G.I.s are not trying to be blondes. So—either take along
your own peroxide or make up your mind to stay brunette until you get back home.”

**On Behavior:** “Don&#8217;t gripe, don&#8217;t feel sorry for yourself,
and don&#8217;t argue with your fellow entertainers in public.”

**On Terminology:** “Don&#8217;t call the soldiers &#8216;boys.&#8217;
The army has worked very hard to turn them into men.”

My performers in [_The Foxhole Victory Tour_](/books/the-foxhole-victory-tour)
kept these rules (well…mostly)…could you?
