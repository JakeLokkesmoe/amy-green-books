Dinah Kendall’s role in the US capital for the Office of Strategic Services is far from the thrilling espionage career she dreamed of. Instead of covert missions, she crafts rumors aimed at undermining Axis morale while trying to live up to the expectations of her demanding mother, Lillian. Yet, as Dinah navigates her duties, she uncovers a startling revelation: Lillian was once a codebreaker during the Great War alongside some of the nation’s most brilliant minds. The deeper Dinah dives into her mother’s journal, the more the secrets of the past come to light—including the heavy cost of high-stakes codebreaking.

Just when Dinah begins to excel in her new position, she is implicated in a series of suspicious activities that cause others to question her loyalty. As she navigates a web of intrigue, she must piece together the truth in time to confront the shadowy threat that could compromise the impending D-Day invasion.
